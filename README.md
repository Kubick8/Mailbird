# Mailbird
Hello, my name is Artem Markov and this is interview tasks for Mailbird. Just follow step by step and you will see the work done by me.
Hope, you will highly appreciate the work done by me and we will continue to cooperate.

On step 1 I analyzed Dataset 1.I cleaned the data and drew many different conclusions. You can see them in the file "Step 1 description.docx" relying on the file "Step 1 visualization.pbix".

On step 2 I wrote a Python code to predict the status of the client. This code you can check in file "Step 2 Predicted Data Code.ipynb" and also you can check file "Step 2 Dataset With Predictions.csv" to see predicted data.

Best Regards,
Artem Markov
