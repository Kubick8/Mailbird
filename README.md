# Mailbird
Hello, my name is Artem Markov and this is interview tasks for Mailbird. Just follow step by step and you will see the work done by me.

On step 1 I analyzed Dataset 1.I cleaned the data and drew many different conclusions. You can see them in the file "Step 1 description.docx" relying on the file "Step 1 visualization.pbix".

On step 2 I wrote a Python code to predict the status of the client. This code you can check in file "Step 2 Predicted Data Code.ipynb" and also you can check file "Step 2 Dataset With Predictions.csv" to see predicted data.

On step 3 I imported data into Power BI, cleaned it, made connections and prepared data for visualization. Subsequently I made 2 dashboards with basic information about Tour de France with visualizations based on the tournament brand.

Hope, you will highly appreciate the work done by me and we will continue to cooperate.
Best Regards,
Artem Markov
